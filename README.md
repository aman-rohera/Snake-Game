2. **Use power-ups strategically** - Save invincibility for tight spots
3. **Learn obstacle patterns** - Each level has predictable layouts
4. **Play in wrap mode** - More freedom of movement for higher scores
5. **Avoid poison early** - Losing segments when small is dangerous
6. **Master the magnet** - Pull food toward you for faster collection
